Potential Enhancement Ideas
1. Security Improvements
Token Revocation on Password Change: Invalidate all outstanding tokens if the user changes their password.
Shorter/Configurable Blacklist Expiry: Allow configurable expiry for blacklisted JTIs depending on token lifetime.
Replay Attack Protection: Add more robust protection and monitoring for repeated use of tokens (especially refresh tokens).
Algorithm Flexibility: Enforce strict algorithm whitelisting and reject tokens with "none" or weak algos.
Token Audience/Issuer Claims: Add support for audience (aud) and issuer (iss) claims, with validation.
2. Extensibility and Abstraction
Pluggable Storage Backends: Make it easier to add new TokenStorage implementations (e.g., file, database, memory cache) via dependency injection or service discovery.
Events or Hooks: Trigger events/hooks on generate, validate, refresh, and blacklist for extensibility.
3. Usability & Developer Experience
Static Analysis/DOC Comments: Add PHPDoc comments for all public methods, describing parameters and return types.
Exception Transparency: Optionally expose exception reasons (e.g., invalid signature, expired) to callers.
Configurable Leeway: JWT validation could allow a small leeway window for clock skew.
4. Testing and Reliability
Unit Tests: Add or enhance automated test coverage for Auth, storages, and edge cases.
CI Integration: Provide a sample GitHub Actions/CI configuration.
